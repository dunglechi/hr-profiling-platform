# üöÄ Autonomous Development Protocol (ADP)
## Designed for AI-Accelerated Technical Implementation

### üéØ OBJECTIVE
Eliminate approval bottlenecks while maintaining code quality and project alignment.

### ‚ö° BATCH APPROVAL SYSTEM

#### **PHASE-BASED APPROVALS** (vs per-action approvals)
- **Development Phase Approval**: Get approval for entire feature/module scope
- **Implementation Autonomy**: Execute all technical tasks within approved scope
- **Checkpoint Reviews**: Review results at logical completion points

#### **PRE-APPROVED TECHNICAL ACTIONS**
The following actions are **automatically approved** within current session scope:

‚úÖ **Code Development:**
- Creating/editing files within project structure
- Implementing features defined in todos/specifications  
- Refactoring existing code for optimization
- Adding dependencies via npm/package managers

‚úÖ **Database Operations:**
- Schema updates following established patterns
- API endpoint creation matching existing structure
- Environment variable additions for new services

‚úÖ **Testing & Quality:**
- Writing unit tests for new functionality
- Running test suites and build processes
- Code formatting and linting fixes

‚úÖ **Documentation:**
- Updating technical documentation
- Adding code comments and README updates
- Creating API documentation

#### **APPROVAL REQUIRED FOR:**
‚ùå **Architectural Changes:**
- Major technology stack modifications
- Database schema breaking changes
- External service integrations requiring API keys

‚ùå **Deployment & Infrastructure:**
- Production deployment commands
- Environment variable changes affecting live systems
- Third-party service configurations

### üìã CURRENT SESSION SCOPE (PRE-APPROVED)
Based on Technical Directive, the following are **pre-approved for autonomous execution:**

1. **MBTI Module Completion**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
2. **AI CV Analysis Service**: 
   - OpenAI integration setup
   - Prompt engineering for skills extraction
   - Secure API handling implementation
3. **CV Upload Interface**:
   - File upload component creation
   - PDF/DOCX text extraction
   - Result display integration
4. **User Management System**:
   - Authentication integration
   - User profile management
   - Session handling

### ‚öôÔ∏è EXECUTION WORKFLOW

#### **AUTONOMOUS DEVELOPMENT CYCLE:**
```
1. Reference Current Todo/Specification
2. Implement Feature Completely  
3. Test & Validate Functionality
4. Commit with Descriptive Message
5. Move to Next Todo Item
6. [CHECKPOINT] Report Progress Every 3-4 Features
```

#### **PROGRESS REPORTING:**
- **Real-time**: Update todo status as work progresses
- **Batch Updates**: Commit multiple related changes together
- **Milestone Reports**: Summary after each major feature completion

### üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

#### **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (NO APPROVAL NEEDED):**
- Continue with todo #3: MBTI-Supabase Integration testing
- Begin todo #4: AI CV Analysis Service implementation
- Implement todo #5: CV Upload Interface
- Add user authentication system
- Create job matching algorithm

#### **QUALITY ASSURANCE:**
- All code follows established patterns in existing codebase
- TypeScript compilation must pass
- Existing functionality must remain unaffected
- Database changes use existing migration patterns

### üìà EFFICIENCY TARGETS

#### **BEFORE ADP:**
- Development Speed: 60-70% overhead from approvals
- Feature Completion: 1-2 features per session
- Context Switches: 10-15 interruptions per hour

#### **AFTER ADP:**
- Development Speed: 95% of pure coding time
- Feature Completion: 5-8 features per session  
- Context Switches: 2-3 milestone checkpoints only

### üéØ SUCCESS METRICS
- **Velocity**: Complete todos #3-5 in current session
- **Quality**: Zero breaking changes to existing functionality
- **Alignment**: All implementations match MVP specifications
- **Communication**: Clear progress updates at checkpoints
