## 2. NECESSITY & PROPORTIONALITY ASSESSMENT

### 2.1 Necessity Analysis

| Proportionate Benefits | ‚ö†Ô∏è QUESTIONABLE | Potential team benefits vs. discrimination risks |

### 2.2 Proportionality Safeguards
- ‚úÖ Reference-Only classification prevents hiring use
- ‚úÖ Explicit bias warnings on all outputs
- ‚úÖ Regional toggle system for compliance variations
- ‚úÖ Kill-switch for emergency data access termination
